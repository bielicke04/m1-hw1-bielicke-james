The only issue I had was trying to launch VS Code via the Terminal when wanting to commit. My terminal is set-up to launch Atom when submitting commits, so I'm going to reach-out to Prof. Warrick to figure out how to update this. I researched on Stack-Flow, but it was a little over my head.

I utilized all of Prof. Blakely's videos when figuring out how to complete this project. I also used Google Images to find the St. Louis Blues hockey image.
